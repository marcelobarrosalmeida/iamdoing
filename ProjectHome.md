iamdoing is a twitter client for S60 phones

Best features of Iamdoing:

  * Support for splitting your message in several 140 char messages, adding "..." and using the proper order for presenting the pieces ;-)
  * Automatic support for generating tiny URLs. Yes, put any URL and it will be converted using http://is.gd service, much smaller then tinyurl.
  * Support to follow links in message. Just click in a message with links and you will have the option for following them using S60 browser.
  * Proxy support (a must have for any modern application)

Even working, this program is in alpha stage and several features are missing.
